# What is CommunityService

`CommunityService` is an interface in the Citi-MyHome project. It provides a set of methods that are used to manage communities within the application. These methods include creating a community, listing all communities, getting community details, and managing community houses and admins.

# Variables and functions

`CommunityService` does not have any variables as it is an interface. However, it declares several methods that must be implemented by any class that implements this interface.
