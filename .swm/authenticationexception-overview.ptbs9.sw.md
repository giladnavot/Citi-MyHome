# What is AuthenticationException

`AuthenticationException` is a custom exception class in the Citi-MyHome project. It extends `RuntimeException` and is thrown when there are authentication errors, such as incorrect credentials or non-existent users.

# Variables and functions

The constant `ERROR_MESSAGE` is used to store the error message that will be displayed when the exception is thrown. It is a static final string with the value 'Credentials are incorrect or user does not exists'.

```java
  private static final String ERROR_MESSAGE = "Credentials are incorrect or user does not exists";
```

The `AuthenticationException` constructor is a no-argument constructor that calls the superclass constructor with the `ERROR_MESSAGE` as the argument.

```java
  public AuthenticationException() {
    super(ERROR_MESSAGE);
  }
```

# Usage example

`UserNotFoundException` class extends `AuthenticationException`. This means that when a user is not found, an `AuthenticationException` is thrown with the `ERROR_MESSAGE` defined in `AuthenticationException`.

```java
public class UserNotFoundException extends AuthenticationException {
  public UserNotFoundException(String userEmail) {
```
