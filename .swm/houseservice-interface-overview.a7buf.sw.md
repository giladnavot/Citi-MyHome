# What is HouseService

`HouseService` is an interface in the Citi-MyHome project that provides a set of methods for managing houses and house members within a community. It is used to list all houses, add members to a house, delete members from a house, get house details by ID, get house members by ID, and list house members for houses of a specific user.
