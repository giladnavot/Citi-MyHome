# What is MailService

`MailService` is an interface in the Citi-MyHome project that defines methods for sending different types of emails to users. These emails include password recovery codes, account creation confirmations, password change notifications, and account confirmation messages.

# Variables and functions

`MailService` does not contain any variables as it is an interface. However, it defines several methods that must be implemented by any class that implements this interface.
